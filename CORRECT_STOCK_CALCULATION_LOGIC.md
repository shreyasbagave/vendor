# ✅ Correct Stock Calculation Logic - FINAL

## 🎯 **CORRECT Business Rule**

### **CR and MR are PART OF OK Quantity!**

This means:
- **OK Qty** = Total dispatched quantity (includes CR and MR within it)
- **CR** = Customer returns (part of OK, not separate)
- **MR** = Material defects (part of OK, not separate)
- **Net Good** = OK - CR - MR (actual approved quantity)
- **As Cast** = Remaining unprocessed stock
- **Total Production** = OK + As Cast (NOT OK + CR + MR + As Cast)

---

## 📊 **Correct Example**

### Production Scenario:
```
Total Production: 1000 units

📦 OK Qty = 500        ← Total dispatched (includes CR & MR)
   ↩ CR = 10          ← Part of the 500 (customer returned)
   ✗ MR = 5           ← Part of the 500 (material defect)
   ✓ Net Good = 485   ← 500 - 10 - 5 (actual approved)

🏭 As Cast = 500       ← Remaining stock (not yet dispatched)

───────────────────────────────────────────
Total = 500 (OK) + 500 (As Cast) = 1000 ✓
```

### Breakdown:
- **Produced:** 1000 units total
- **Dispatched (OK):** 500 units
  - Good approved: 485 units
  - Customer returned (CR): 10 units ← within the 500
  - Material defect (MR): 5 units ← within the 500
- **Remaining (As Cast):** 500 units (not yet processed/dispatched)

---

## 🧮 **Formulas**

### Main Formula:
```
Total Production = OK + As Cast
```

### Quality Calculation:
```
Net Good Quantity = OK - CR - MR
```

### Validation:
```
CR + MR must be ≤ OK
(because they are part of OK)
```

---

## ✅ **What the System Does**

### 1. **Yellow Warning Box** (Top)
Shows:
```
⚠️ Important: CR and MR are PART OF OK Quantity

OK Qty = Total dispatched (includes CR & MR within it)
CR = Customer returns (part of OK, not separate)
MR = Material defects (part of OK, not separate)
Net Good = OK - CR - MR
Total = OK + As Cast (NOT OK + CR + MR + As Cast)
```

### 2. **Color-Coded Input Fields**

| Field | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **OK Qty** 📦 | 🟢 Green | Total dispatched (includes CR & MR) |
| **CR Qty** ↩ | 🟠 Orange | Part of OK (Customer return) |
| **MR Qty** ✗ | 🔴 Red | Part of OK (Material defect) |
| **As Cast** 🏭 | 🟣 Purple | Remaining stock |

### 3. **Two Calculation Boxes**

**Box 1: Total Production**
```
Total Production: 1000.00
= OK (500.00) + As Cast (500.00)
```

**Box 2: Net Good (Approved)**
```
Net Good (Approved): 485.00
= OK (500.00) - CR (10.00) - MR (5.00)
```

### 4. **Live Example**
```
Total Production = 1000 units
📦 OK Qty = 500 (total dispatched)
   ↩ CR = 10 (within OK, customer returned)
   ✗ MR = 5 (within OK, material defect)
   ✓ Net Good = 485 (500 - 10 - 5)
🏭 As Cast = 500 (remaining stock)
───────────────────────────────────────
Total = 500 (OK) + 500 (As Cast) = 1000 ✓

⚠️ CR + MR must not exceed OK quantity!
```

---

## 🔒 **Validations**

The system prevents invalid entries:

### ✅ Validation 1: CR + MR cannot exceed OK
```javascript
if (CR + MR > OK) {
    Error: "CR + MR quantities cannot exceed OK quantity (they are part of OK)"
}
```

**Example:**
- ❌ OK = 100, CR = 60, MR = 50 → **INVALID** (110 > 100)
- ✅ OK = 100, CR = 60, MR = 40 → **VALID** (100 = 100)
- ✅ OK = 100, CR = 30, MR = 20 → **VALID** (50 < 100)

### ✅ Validation 2: Total must be greater than 0
```javascript
if (OK + As Cast <= 0) {
    Error: "Total quantity must be greater than 0"
}
```

### ✅ Validation 3: All quantities must be non-negative
```javascript
All fields must be >= 0
```

## 📝 **Data Entry Workflow**

### Method A: Enter Total First (Auto-calculate As Cast)
```
Step 1: Enter Total Production Quantity: 1000
Step 2: Enter OK Qty: 500
Step 3: As Cast auto-calculates: 500 ← (1000 - 500)
Step 4: Enter CR: 10 (part of the 500)
Step 5: Enter MR: 5 (part of the 500)
Step 6: System shows Net Good: 485 (500 - 10 - 5)
```

### Method B: Enter Individual Quantities
```
Step 1: Skip Total Production Quantity
Step 2: Enter OK Qty: 500
Step 3: Enter CR: 10
Step 4: Enter MR: 5
Step 5: Enter As Cast: 500
Step 6: System calculates Total: 1000 (500 + 500)
Step 7: System shows Net Good: 485 (500 - 10 - 5)
```

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators**

### Field Backgrounds:
- **Green box** (OK) = "This is total dispatched"
- **Orange box** (CR) = "Part of OK - customer returned"
- **Red box** (MR) = "Part of OK - material defect"
- **Purple box** (As Cast) = "Remaining stock"

### Labels:
- "Total dispatched (includes CR & MR)" ← on OK field
- "Part of OK (Customer return)" ← on CR field
- "Part of OK (Material defect)" ← on MR field
- "Remaining stock" ← on As Cast field

---

## 🚫 **Common Mistakes AVOIDED**

### ❌ Wrong Calculation:
```
Total = OK + CR + MR + As Cast
Total = 500 + 10 + 5 + 500 = 1015 ← WRONG!
```

### ✅ Correct Calculation:
```
Total = OK + As Cast
Total = 500 + 500 = 1000 ← CORRECT!
(CR and MR are already within the 500 OK units)
```

## 📊 **Summary Table Footer**

The summary row at the bottom shows:
- **Total OK**: Sum of all OK quantities
- **Total CR**: Sum of all CR quantities (subset of OK)
- **Total MR**: Sum of all MR quantities (subset of OK)
- **Total As Cast**: Sum of all As Cast quantities
- **Grand Total**: Sum of all Total quantities (OK + As Cast)

---

## 🎯 **Real-World Analogy**

Think of it like a shipping container:

```
📦 Container (OK Qty = 500 items shipped)
   ├─ ✓ Good items: 485
   ├─ ↩ Customer returned: 10  } These are INSIDE
   └─ ✗ Defective: 5            } the container

🏭 Factory warehouse (As Cast = 500 items not yet shipped)

Total inventory = 500 (shipped) + 500 (warehouse) = 1000
```

The customer returns (CR) and defects (MR) are **inside** the shipped container (OK), not separate from it.

## ✅ **Testing Examples**

### Test 1: Valid Entry
```
OK = 500, CR = 10, MR = 5, As Cast = 500
✅ Valid: CR + MR (15) < OK (500)
✅ Total = 500 + 500 = 1000
✅ Net Good = 500 - 10 - 5 = 485
```

### Test 2: Invalid Entry (CR + MR > OK)
```
OK = 100, CR = 60, MR = 50, As Cast = 500
❌ Invalid: CR + MR (110) > OK (100)
❌ Error: "CR + MR quantities cannot exceed OK quantity"
```

### Test 3: Perfect Production
```
OK = 1000, CR = 0, MR = 0, As Cast = 0
✅ Valid: All produced items were good and dispatched
✅ Total = 1000 + 0 = 1000
✅ Net Good = 1000 - 0 - 0 = 1000
```

## 🎊 **Summary**

Your application now **correctly implements** the business logic where:

1. ✅ **CR and MR are part of OK** (not separate additions)
2. ✅ **Total = OK + As Cast** (simplified formula)
3. ✅ **Net Good = OK - CR - MR** (actual approved quantity)
4. ✅ **Validation prevents CR + MR > OK**
5. ✅ **Clear visual indicators** show the relationship
6. ✅ **Live examples** demonstrate correct usage
7. ✅ **Color-coded fields** make data entry intuitive

**The system is now production-ready with the correct logic!** 🎉
