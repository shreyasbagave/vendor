```

Each line tells you which field has a problem!

### Step 2: Open Browser Console

   Submit error: [Error details]
   Validation errors: [Array of errors]
   ```

### Step 3: Check Network Tab

1. Press **F12**
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Submit the form
4. Click on the failed request (will be red)
5. Click **Response** tab
6. See the exact error from server:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "message": "Please check all required fields",
     "errors": [
       {
         "field": "supplier",
         "message": "Supplier is required"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
